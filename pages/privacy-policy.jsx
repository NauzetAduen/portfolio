        <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          Your privacy is critically important to us. It is my policy to respect
          your privacy regarding any information I may collect while operating
          my website. This Privacy Policy applies to nauzet.web.app.
        </p>
        <p>
          I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting personally
          identifiable information you may provide me through the Website. I
          have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what
          information may be collected on my Website, how I use this
          information, and under what circumstances I may disclose the
          information to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies only to information I collect through the
          Website and does not apply to my collection of information from other
          sources. This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions
          posted on my Website, set forth the general rules and policies
          governing your use of my Website. Depending on your activities when
          visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms

        </p>
        Website Visitors Like most website operators, adedelivered.com collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. adedelivered.com's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how adedelivered.com's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, adedelivered.com may
        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
        by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        adedelivered.com also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on adedelivered.com blog posts.
        adedelivered.com only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
        addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below. Gathering of
        Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to
        adedelivered.com's websites choose to interact with adedelivered.com in
        ways that require adedelivered.com to gather personally-identifying
        information. The amount and type of information that adedelivered.com
        gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
        visitors who sign up for a blog at http://adedelivered.com to provide a
        username and email address. Security The security of your Personal
        Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
        secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
        your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
